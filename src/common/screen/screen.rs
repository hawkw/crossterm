///

/// // create default screen.
/// let screen = Screen::default();
/// // create raw screen.
/// let mut screen = Screen::new(true);
///
/// // write some text to the internal buffer of this type.
/// screen.write(b"Some text");
/// screen.write(b"Some more text");
/// screen.write(b"Some more text");

/// // write the above text by flushing the internal buffer of this type.
/// screen.flush();
