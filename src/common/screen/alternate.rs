//! This module contains all the logic for switching between alternate screen and main screen.
//!
//!
//! *Nix style applications often utilize an alternate screen buffer, so that they can modify the entire contents of the buffer, without affecting the application that started them.
//! The alternate buffer is exactly the dimensions of the window, without any scrollback region.
//! For an example of this behavior, consider when vim is launched from bash.
//! Vim uses the entirety of the screen to edit the file, then returning to bash leaves the original buffer unchanged.
